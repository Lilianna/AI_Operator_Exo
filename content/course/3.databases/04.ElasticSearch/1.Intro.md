# Elasticsearch

The main part of the content of this document is coming from the official website of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch).

## What is Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is a distributed, free and open search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. 

Elasticsearch is built on Apache Lucene and was first released in 2010. It is known for its simple REST APIs, distributed nature, speed, and scalability.

The speed and scalability of Elasticsearch and its ability to index many types of content mean that it can be used for a number of use cases:

- Search engine (on applications, websites...)
- Logging and log analytics
- Geospatial data analysis and visualization
- Business analytics

## How does Elasticsearch work?

Raw data flows into Elasticsearch from a variety of sources, including logs, system metrics, and web applications. Data ingestion is the process by which this raw data is parsed, normalized, and enriched before it is indexed in Elasticsearch. Once indexed in Elasticsearch, users can run complex queries against their data and use aggregations to retrieve complex summaries of their data.

## What is an Elasticsearch index?

An Elasticsearch index is a collection of documents that are related to each other. Elasticsearch stores data as JSON documents, exactly as MongoDB. Each document correlates a set of keys (names of fields or properties) with their corresponding values (strings, numbers, Booleans, dates, arrays of values, geolocations, or other types of data).

Elasticsearch uses a data structure called an **inverted index**, which is designed to allow very fast full-text searches. An inverted index lists every unique word that appears in any document and identifies all of the documents each word occurs in.

During the indexing process, Elasticsearch stores documents and builds an inverted index to make the document data searchable in near real-time. Indexing is initiated with the index API, through which you can add or update a JSON document in a specific index.

## Why use Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is fast and it excels at full-text search. Elasticsearch is also a near real-time search platform, meaning the latency from the time a document is indexed until it becomes searchable is very short — typically one second. As a result, Elasticsearch is well suited for time-sensitive use cases such as security analytics and infrastructure monitoring.

Elasticsearch is distributed by nature. The documents stored in Elasticsearch are distributed across different containers known as **shards**, which are duplicated to provide redundant copies of the data in case of hardware failure. The distributed nature of Elasticsearch allows it to scale out to hundreds (or even thousands) of servers and handle huge amounts of data..

## What text languages does Elasticsearch support?

Elasticsearch supports 34 text languages, from Arabic to Thai, and provides analyzers for each. The full list can be found in the Elasticsearch Language Analyzer documentation. Support for additional languages can be added with custom plugins.

## Popular use cases

Elasticsearch is broadly used in the market, in various use cases.

The main purpose of Elasticsearch is to provide **search engines**. A lot of companies are using it in their website search bar, providing their users with a Google-like search of the site's contents. Among others, the search bars of Github, Wikipedia and Amazon are based on it! But the companies also use it to search in their internal documents. For instance Airbus provides an internal search engine for accessing Aircraft technical documents in real-time.

Numerous companies use Elasticsearch for **log analysis** and **data visualization** using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). Elasticsearch indexes and stores the data, Logstash collects data and processes this, and Kibana provides a user interface for querying the data and visualising the data. For instance, Netflix is using this Stack for monitoring and analysing customer service operations and security logs.

Elasticsearch is also used for **metrics analysis** based on data from remote sensors, IoT devices, customer data...For instance Walmart uses Elasticseatch to gain insights about customer purchasing patterns, track store performance metrics, and holiday analytics — all in near real-time.
