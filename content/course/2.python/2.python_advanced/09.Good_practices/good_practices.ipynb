    "# Good practices\n",
    "\n",
    "In python as in other languages, there are conventions on how to write code. You don't have to respect all of them, but some of them have become unanimously used. Let's see together a summary of the most important rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PEP8 in summary!\n",
    "\n",
    "[PEP 8 (for Python Extension Proposal)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is a set of rules that allows to homogenize the code and to apply good practices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python aims to be a language \"that can be read\" rather than \"a language that can be written\". Writing understandable code for a machine is rather easy, but writing understandable code by the greatest number of coders (of any level) is a different story...\n",
    "\n",
    "PEP 8 provides rules and conventions to make reading easier and thus less stressed and more productive. You can tell from reading a script that the author hasn't followed these basic rules and may assume is not a good coder. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an data professional, you will often be part of teams and having good coding practices will ensure your code is unerstandable, readble, and usable!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The indentation in your code must be 4 characters. More is too much, less is not enough. "
